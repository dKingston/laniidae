<builder name="Moc4">
<summary>
Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are either
header files or cxx files. This builder is only available after using the
tool 'qt4'. It should be your first choice when manually Mocing files
and is the builder for the Q_OBJECT driven Automoc strategy (#0, the default).
It can can be controlled via the QT4_MOC* variables. See the &cv-link-QT4DIR; and
&cv-link-QT4_AUTOSCAN_STRATEGY; variables for more information.
Example:

<example>
env.Moc4('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc4('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="XMoc4">
<summary>
Just like the &b-Moc4; builder, it builds an output file from a moc input file.
Moc input files are either header files or cxx files. This builder is only available after using the
tool 'qt4'. It is defined separately for the include driven Automoc strategy (#1)
and can be controlled via the QT4_XMOC* variables. See the &cv-link-QT4DIR; and
&cv-link-QT4_AUTOSCAN_STRATEGY; variables for more information.
Example:

<example>
env.XMoc4('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cpp
env.XMoc4('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="ExplicitMoc4">
<summary>
Just like the &b-Moc4; builder, it builds an output file from a moc input file.
However, it does not use any default prefix or suffix for the filenames.
You can, and have to, specify the full source and target names explicitly.
This builder is only available after using the
tool 'qt4'. It can be your last resort, when you have to moc single files
from/to exotic filenames.
Example:

<example>
env.ExplicitMoc4('moced_foo.cxx','foo.h') # generates moced_foo.cxx
</example>
</summary>
</builder>


<builder name="Uic4">
<summary>
Builds a header file from an .ui file, where the former
contains the setup code for a GUI class.
This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt4'.
Using this builder lets you override the standard
naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of
built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set them to ``).
See the &cv-link-QT4DIR; variable for more information.
Example:

<example>
env.Uic4('foo.ui') # -> 'ui_foo.h'
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="ExplicitUic4">
<summary>
Just like the &b-Uic4; builder, it builds a header file from a .ui input file.
However, it does not use any default prefix or suffix for the filenames.
You can, and have to, specify the full source and target names explicitly.
This builder is only available after using the
tool 'qt4'. It can be your last resort, when you have to convert .ui
files to exotic filenames.
Example:

<example>
env.ExplicitUic4('uiced_foo.hpp','foo.ui') # generates uiced_foo.hpp
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="Qrc4">
<summary>
Builds a cxx file, containing all resources from the given
.qrc file.
This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt4'.

Example:

<example>
env.Qrc4('foo.qrc') # -> ['qrc_foo.cc']
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name="Ts4">
<summary>
Scans the source files in the given path for tr() marked strings,
that should get translated. Writes a .ts file for the Qt Linguist.
This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt4'.

Example:

<example>
env.Ts4('foo.ts','.') # -> ['foo.ts']
</example>
</summary>
</builder>


<builder name="Qm4">
<summary>
Compiles a given .ts file (Qt Linguist) into a binary .qm file.
This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt4'.

Example:

<example>
env.Qm4('foo.ts') # -> ['foo.qm']
</example>
</summary>
</builder>


<cvar name="QT4DIR">
<summary>
The Qt4 tool tries to read this from the current Environment and then from os.environ.
If it is not set and found, the value of QTDIR (in the Environment and os.environ) is
used as a fallback.
It also initializes all QT4_*
construction variables listed below.
(Note that all paths are constructed
with python's os.path.join() method,
but are listed here with the '/' separator
for easier reading.)
In addition, the construction environment
variables &cv-link-CPPPATH;,
&cv-link-LIBPATH; and
&cv-link-LIBS; may be modified
and the variables
PROGEMITTER, SHLIBEMITTER and LIBEMITTER
are modified. Because the build-performance is affected when using this tool,
you have to explicitly specify it at Environment creation:

<example>
Environment(tools=['default','qt4'])
</example>

The Qt4 tool supports the following operations:

<emphasis Role="strong">Automatic moc file generation from header files.</emphasis>
You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have
the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same
directory. It must have one of the suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You
can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting &cv-link-QT4_AUTOSCAN; to 0.
See also the corresponding builder method
&b-Moc4;().

<emphasis Role="strong">Automatic moc file generation from cxx files.</emphasis>
As stated in the Qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of
the cxx file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
by the transformation ${QT4_MOCCXXPREFIX}&lt;basename&gt;${QT4_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
&lt;basename&gt;.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc file, if you
do not include the correct file. If you are using VariantDir, you may
need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn off automatic moc file generation
by setting &cv-link-QT4_AUTOSCAN; to 0. See also the corresponding
&b-Moc4;
builder method.

<cvar name="QT4_UISUFFIX">
<summary>
Default value is '.ui'. Suffix of designer input files (form files) in Qt4.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_AUTOSCAN_STRATEGY">
<summary>
Default value is '0'. When using the Automoc feature of the Qt4 tool, you
can select different strategies for detecting which files should get moced.
The simple approach ('0' as the default) scans header and source files for
the Q_OBJECT macro, so the trigger 'moc or not' is Q_OBJECT driven. If it is
found, the corresponding file gets moced with
the &b-Moc4; builder. This results in the files 'moc_foo.cc' and 'foo.moc' for header
and source file, respectively. They get added to the list of sources, for compiling
the current library or program.

In older Qt manuals, a different technique for mocing is recommended. A cxx file
includes the moced output of itself or its header at the end. This approach is somewhat
deprecated, but the 'qtsolutions' by Qt are still based on it, for example. You also
might have to switch older Qt sources to a new version 4.x.y. Then you can set
this variable to '1', for 'include driven' mocing. This means that the tool searches
for '#include' statements in all cxx files, containing a file pattern 'moc_foo.cpp'
and 'foo.moc' for header and source file, respectively. If the file 'foo.h/foo.cpp'
then contains a Q_OBJECT macro, it gets moced but is NOT added to the list of sources.
This is the important difference between the two strategies. If no matching
include patterns are found for the current cxx file, the Q_OBJECT driven method (#0)
is tried as fallback.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_AUTOMOC_SCANCPPPATH">
<summary>
The default is '1', meaning that the tool scans 
for mocable files not only in the current directory, but
also in all CPPPATH folders (see also &cv-link-QT4_AUTOMOC_CPPPATH;).
You can set this variable to '0' to
switch it off on rare occasions, e.g. when too many search
folders give you a bad performance in large projects.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_AUTOMOC_CPPPATH">
<summary>
The list of paths to scan for mocable files
(see also &cv-link-QT4_AUTOMOC_SCANCPPPATH;), it is empty by default
which means that the CPPPATH variable is used.
You can set this variable to a subset of CPPPATH in order
to improve performance, i.e. to minimize the search space.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_GOBBLECOMMENTS">
<summary>
Default value is '0' (disabled). When you set this variable to '1',
you enable the automatic removal of C/C++ comments, while searching for
the Q_OBJECT keyword during the Automoc process. This can be helpful if you
have the string Q_OBJECT in one of your comments, but don't want this
file to get moced.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_CPPDEFINES_PASSTOMOC">
<summary>
Default value is '1' (enabled). When you set this variable to '1',
all currently set CPPDEFINES get passed to the moc executable. It does not matter
which strategy you selected with &cv-link-QT4_AUTOSCAN_STRATEGY; or whether you
call the &b-Moc4; builder directly.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="QT4_CLEAN_TS">
<summary>
Default value is '0' (disabled). When you set this variable to '1',
the &b-Ts4; builder will delete your .ts files on a 'scons -c'. Normally,
these files for the QtLinguist are treated as 'precious' (they are not removed
prior to a rebuild) and do not get cleaned.
</summary>
